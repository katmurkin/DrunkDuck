<h2>Design Document - User testing</h2>
<br>
<p>User testing was completed online, via a live webpage. Testers were given the link and a series of aspects 
to return comments on. The webmap went through three iterations due to various updates and bugs which needed 
fixing before users submitted their final views. User comments are given in the table below, with information 
about subsequent actions taken. </p>
<br>

<table style="width:60%", >
<caption>Table 1. User tester comments.</caption>

	    <td>1, 3</td>
	    <td>Pubs missing from local canal.</td>
	    <td>No update &#8208; issue with missing pubs was identified as incomplete dataset and mismatch between 
	    postcode location and physical location. Time taken to add in additional pubs would reduce time 
	    spent on functionality and performance.  If pubs continue to be geolocated by postcode then size 
	    of postcode area should be considered when applying the canal buffer to avoid incorrectly excluding 
	    some canalside premises.</td>

	    <td>When filtering results, it's not immediately clear whether that will 
	    only show results that match all of your selection criteria, or results will include everything 
	    matching just one of your selection. Also not clear if nothing is ticked, that all results will 
	    be shown. (Maybe explain in a help/ instructions box that pops up first time loading page?).</td>
	    <td>Changed checkbox formatting to more generic Unicode characters. Help box added below checkboxes 
	    to explain filter functionality.</td>

	    turf library to locate nearest point on canal.</td>

	    problem. Updated and simplified line geometry of original shapefile and re&#8208;exported 
	    to solve issue.</td>

	    <td>Identified ArcGIS export function has an outstanding bug which reverses direction 
	    of every linestring when exporting to KMZ.  Corrected by flipping all lines before export. 
	    Some lengths inconsistent due to incorrect turf syntax used, corrected this.</td>

	    <td>1</td>
	    <td>Final map works much better. Easier to select canal, although tend to select on map, 
	    rather than dropdown. Woks well on mobile device. Format seems mobile friendly. One 
	    possible update would be to have distances in miles rather than km, or to have it as a 
	    selectable option as most boaters work in miles.</td>
